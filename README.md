Probably the player favorite so far is GIF vs AI - a twist on the popular Death by AI game. The AI generates a life threatening scenario and a GIF is chosen to represent it. Players then have to respond with how they'll attempt to survive by selecting a GIF. Finally the AI evaluates the scenario and the provided survival GIF to determine if the player survives and selects a GIF to represent the outcome. Adding in the GIFs makes the game faster to play and the AI interpretation of the GIF can lead to un-intended and funny outcomes.
